1. How many departments are there in the “employees” database? Use the ‘dept_emp’ table to answer the question ?

2. What is the total amount of money spent on salaries for all contracts starting after the 1st of January 1997?

3. Which is the lowest employee number in the database?

4. Which is the highest employee number in the database?

5. What is the average annual salary paid to employees who started after the 1st of January 1997?

6. Round the average amount of money spent on salaries for all contracts that 
started after the 1st of January 1997 to a precision of cents.

7. Select the department number and name from the ‘departments_dup’ table and add a third column 
where you name the department number (‘dept_no’) as ‘dept_info’. 
If ‘dept_no’ does not have a value, use ‘dept_name’.

8. Modify the code obtained from the previous exercise in the following way. Apply the IFNULL() function 
to the values from the first and second column, so that ‘N/A’ is displayed whenever a department number has no value, 
and ‘Department name not provided’ is shown if there is no value for ‘dept_name’.
